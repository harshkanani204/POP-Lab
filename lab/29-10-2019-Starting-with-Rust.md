# Starting with Rust

1. Please follow the rust book and implement a hello world program
   both as a standalone program (compiled using rustc) and as a
   package using (cargo)

   <https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-00-getting-started.html>

2. Download the [`feature.rs`][features.rs] file from the repository
   and try out various examples of move semantics and ownership.

[features.rs]: <../rust/features.rs>
