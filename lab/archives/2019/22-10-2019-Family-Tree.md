# Family tree


In this lab we will get started with prolog. Down load the file
[`relation.pl`][relation.pl] from this repository and execute various
queries.


1. The current version of the `brother/2` is not really the brother
   relation but more like sibling. Rename the brother relation to
   sibling and define two relations `brother/2` and `sister/2` based
   on that.
   
2. Define the ancestor relation based on the relations that are given.
   Add more facts so that we can query for ancestor relation.


## Bonus (ungraded)

Can you define some of the "cousin" relation as described in
